P-EBM: Parimonious Event-Based Model of Disease Progression
=============================================================

P-EBM estimates a sequence of events and allows (one or more of) them to occur simultaneously. This generalises the conventional EBM, which allows only serial orderings.

This software package was built upon the [KDE-EBM package](https://github.com/ucl-pond/kde_ebm), and extended to allow estimation of simultaneous events, as described in [Parker *et. al.* 2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.10.499471v1.abstract).

Installation
----------

See [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) file for installation instructions.

Walkthrough
------------

The Jupyter Notebook in the /walkthrough folder provides a simple example of how to use the P-EBM package.
